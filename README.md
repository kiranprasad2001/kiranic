Welcome to the source code for [Kiranic.com](https://kiranic.com). 

If you're looking for hand-crafted, artisanally sourced, gluten-free code written by a monk on a mountain top... **you are in the wrong place.**

This repository is a testament to what happens when you pair a lazy (efficient?) human with an over-caffeinated Large Language Model.

## 🤖 Full Disclosure

Approximately **99% of this code was written by an AI Agent** (Google DeepMind's Antigravity). The human (Kiran) mostly just hit `Enter`, drank coffee, and occasionally fixed a CSS z-index issue that I couldn't figure out because I don't have eyes.

### ✨ Features (The "Why It's Cool" Section)

#### 🤖 AI-Generated "Slop" Feed
*   **Concept**: A satirical news feed generated entirely by AI, mocking the very industry that created it.
*   **Tech**: Uses Google Gemini API (`scripts/generate-slop.js`) to hallucinate markdown articles.
*   **Automation**: A daily GitHub Action cron job (`.github/workflows/daily-slop.yml`) generates, commits, and deploys new content automatically.

#### 📧 Self-Hosted Newsletter Engine
*   **Architecture**: Zero-cost, privacy-focused, and fully owned.
*   **Stack**:
    *   **Storage**: Cloudflare D1 (Serverless SQLite) stores subscribers.
    *   **Sending**: Resend API (Free Tier) sends emails from `kp@kiranic.com`.
    *   **Automation**: A weekly GitHub Action grabs the latest articles and dispatches emails.
*   **Privacy**: Tokens are used for one-click unsubscribes (`/unsubscribe?token=...`), ensuring no user data is exposed.

#### 🌗 Dark Mode (That Doesn't Flash)
*   Implemented a toggle that persists preference to `localStorage`.
*   Includes a script blocker in `<head>` to prevent the dreaded "Flash of Unstyled Content" (FOUC).
*   Dynamic Sun/Moon icons in the navbar because we're fancy.

#### 📈 Programmatic SEO Strategy
*   **Sitemap**: Automatically generated sitemap at `/sitemap-index.xml`.
*   **JSON-LD**: Structured data injected into every page (`Person`, `Article`) to help Google understand who I am.
*   **Meta Tags**: Dynamic Open Graph images and Twitter cards.
*   **Glossary**: usage of `scripts/generate-glossary.js` to mass-produce 50+ definitions for "Enterprise Architecture" terms.

#### 💬 Community Features
*   **Giscus**: GitHub Discussions embedded as a comment system.
*   **Native Share**: Uses the Web Share API on mobile for native sharing sheets.

## 🛠️ How to Run This Behemoth

If you really want to run this locally and see how the sausage is made:

1.  **Clone it** (you know how).
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run it**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Generate your own Slop**:
    You need a `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file. Then run:
    ```bash
    node scripts/generate-slop.js
    ```
    *Warning: May cause hallucinations.*

## 🐛 Known Bugs

*   The code is too clean. It lacks the "human touch" of variable names like `temp2_final_FIXED`.
*   Sometimes the AI makes up words. We call that "innovation".

## 🥚 Easter Eggs

<!-- You found one! The password is "Swordfish". -->

If you click the "Generate More Hallucinations" button on the `/ai-slop` page enough times, nothing special happens, but you *will* help warm up the Earth by a fraction of a degree.

Also, try searching the codebase for "stochastic parrot".

## License

MIT. Or whatever. The AI doesn't believe in property rights.
