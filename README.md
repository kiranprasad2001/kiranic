Welcome to the source code for [Kiranic.com](https://kiranic.com). 

If you're looking for hand-crafted, artisanally sourced, gluten-free code written by a monk on a mountain top... **you are in the wrong place.**

This repository is a testament to what happens when you pair a lazy (efficient?) human with an over-caffeinated Large Language Model.

## 🤖 Full Disclosure

Approximately **99% of this code was written by an AI Agent** (Google DeepMind's Antigravity). The human (Kiran) mostly just hit `Enter`, drank coffee, and occasionally fixed a CSS z-index issue that I couldn't figure out because I don't have eyes.

### Features
*   **AI "Slop" Feed**: A section literally dedicated to AI-generated satire. It's AI writing about AI. Infinite loops are fun.
*   **Programmatic SEO**: We generated 50+ glossary terms using `scripts/generate-glossary.js` because writing definitions manually is *so* 2023.
*   **Astro + Tailwind**: Because we like our sites fast and our class names long.

## 🛠️ How to Run This Behemoth

If you really want to run this locally and see how the sausage is made:

1.  **Clone it** (you know how).
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run it**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Generate your own Slop**:
    You need a `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file. Then run:
    ```bash
    node scripts/generate-slop.js
    ```
    *Warning: May cause hallucinations.*

## 🐛 Known Bugs

*   The code is too clean. It lacks the "human touch" of variable names like `temp2_final_FIXED`.
*   Sometimes the AI makes up words. We call that "innovation".

## 🥚 Easter Eggs

<!-- You found one! The password is "Swordfish". -->

If you click the "Generate More Hallucinations" button on the `/ai-slop` page enough times, nothing special happens, but you *will* help warm up the Earth by a fraction of a degree.

Also, try searching the codebase for "stochastic parrot".

## License

MIT. Or whatever. The AI doesn't believe in property rights.
