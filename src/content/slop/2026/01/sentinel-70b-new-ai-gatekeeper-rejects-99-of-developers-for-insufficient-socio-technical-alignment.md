summary: "Access to Acme Corp's cutting-edge API now requires passing a five-hour Turing Test administered by a dedicated 70-billion-parameter LLM. Designed purely to detect 'vibe dissonance' and 'founder grit,' Sentinel-70B is eliminating the 'wrong kind of user' at astronomical inference costs."

In a move lauded by venture capital firms obsessed with 'high-friction onboarding,' Acme Corp has rolled out Sentinel-70B, a proprietary Large Language Model dedicated solely to API key provisioning. The model, which runs on an expensive, horizontally-scaled cluster of H100s, is fine-tuned on a corpus consisting primarily of *highly-curated* Hacker News comment threads, motivational Slack messages from failed startups, and five years of Y Combinator application rejection letters. Its stated goal is not security, but quality control: ensuring that API consumers possess the necessary 'passion for disruptive innovation' before they can incur a single millisecond of inference time.

During the onboarding sequence, prospective developers are subjected to a series of increasingly existential and culturally specific prompts. These include justifying their current stack choice using only nautical metaphors, explaining why they are 'building in public,' and rating their personal burnout level on a proprietary 'Hustle Index.' Sentinel-70B then cross-references the tone, syntax, and inferred caffeine consumption against its training data, calculating a **Socio-Technical Alignment Score (STAS)**. Sources indicate that any score below 8.5/10 results in an immediate, personalized, and deeply patronizing rejection message informing the applicant that their 'current iteration is not market-ready.' The rejection rate has stabilized at 99.3%.

Acme Corp CEO, Chad ‘The Disrupter’ Bronson, defended the $40 million annual operational cost during a recent press event. “We’re not just providing an API; we’re cultivating a *synergistic ecosystem*,” Bronson stated, while standing next to a server rack wrapped in neon lighting. “The friction Sentinel-70B introduces is purposeful, productive friction. By spending millions to reject users, we are effectively self-selecting for customers who truly understand the value—and the **inherent scalability debt**—of our platform. Plus, it solved our immediate GPU bottleneck problem by limiting demand to literally only our investors’ children.”
