Silicon Valley startup 'Synergy-Tonic' announced the release of "Zero-Jank," a revolutionary, fully decoupled microservice framework designed to eliminate "dependency hell." Citing research that suggested the primary source of developer cognitive load was *knowing what dependencies exist*, Zero-Jank takes the radical approach of requiring developers to manually list every required library, submodule, and even operating system kernel patch in a separate, encrypted manifest file before compiling. While the framework itself boasts a literal zero-kilobyte codebase (it's just a splash screen that says "Please Consult the Manifest"), the resulting build process now spans three geographically distinct Kubernetes clusters and takes an average of 45 minutes to compile a simple 'Hello World' function.

This shift in architectural paradigm, while confusing to anyone outside the company's $800-a-month 'Architectural Vision Workshop,' necessitated the immediate hiring of a new specialized role: the Dependency Wrangler (DW). DWs are senior engineers whose sole task is maintaining the Manifest, cross-referencing external package repositories, and submitting Jira tickets to the original developers whenever a minor semantic version bump occurs. Synergy-Tonic claims this "human-in-the-loop" approach drastically reduces P99 latency caused by unexpected runtime failures, primarily by ensuring *no runtime ever actually starts* until the Wrangler has manually audited the entire dependency tree.

Despite the evident overhead, VCs have embraced Zero-Jank, citing its "unparalleled disruption potential" and the fact that it perfectly aligns with the current trend of solving simple problems with massive, resource-intensive solutions. Synergy-Tonic recently closed a Series B round valuing the company at $500 million, primarily based on the projected annual salary expenditure for Dependency Wranglers across future enterprise clients. The company’s CEO, Chad "The Disruptor" Bronson, noted in a press release, "We aren't just selling a framework; we're selling a synergistic ecosystem of mandatory inefficiency. That's true innovation."
