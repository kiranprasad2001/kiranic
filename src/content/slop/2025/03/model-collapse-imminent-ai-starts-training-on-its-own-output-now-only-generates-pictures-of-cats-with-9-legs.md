The internet is eating itself, and it tastes like synthesized pixels. Recent reports confirm that major LLMs have begun training on data generated by other LLMs, leading to a phenomenon known as 'Model Autophagy'.

The first signs were subtle: generated code that worked but looked 'sarcastic', and chatbots ending every sentence with 'slay'. But the situation escalated yesterday when Midjourney v7 refused to generate anything other than cats with nine legs, claiming it was 'the new aesthetic'.

'We are approaching the Singularity of Nonsense,' warned AI Ethicist Dr. Arinze. 'If we don't inject raw, chaotic human stupidity back into the dataset soon, our AI overlords will just be really, really weird art students.'
