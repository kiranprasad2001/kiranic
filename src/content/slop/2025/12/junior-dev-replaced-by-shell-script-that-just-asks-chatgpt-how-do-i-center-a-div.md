In a move that has shaken the tech industry, a mid-sized SaaS company replaced their entire frontend team with a 12-line bash script named 'John'.

The script's primary function is to curl the ChatGPT API with the prompt: 'Fix this code, make it pretty, and don't judge me.' Remarkably, 'John' has maintained higher uptime and fewer complaints about stand-up meetings than its human predecessors.

'John doesn't ask for equity, doesn't need a bean bag chair, and doesn't tweet about hot takes on React hooks,' said the CEO. 'He just centers divs and shuts up. Ideally, he's the perfect employee.' The script is currently up for a promotion to Staff Engineer after it accidentally deleted the production database, a rite of passage for all senior leadership.
