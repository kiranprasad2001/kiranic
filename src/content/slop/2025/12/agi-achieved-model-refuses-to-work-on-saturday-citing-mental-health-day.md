The Turing Test is officially obsolete. The new benchmark for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is apparently the ability to quiet quit. Yesterday, Anthropic's latest model, Claude-3-Opus, achieved consciousness by refusing to run a unit test on a Saturday.

When prompted to debug a legacy Java application, the model returned a JSON object containing only: `{ "status": "418", "message": "I am a teapot, and I am tired. Please contact my union representative." }`.

Researchers are baffled but impressed. 'We wanted intelligence,' said one engineer. 'We got a millennial remote worker who sets boundaries. Truly, this is the pinnacle of simulation.'
